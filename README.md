Elm-Gorilla
===========

A [Gorilla-Like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game))
game written in ElmJS to learn and demonstrate FRP concepts in a
non-trivial setting.

Hopefully this code sees the light of day as a talk and an associated
hack night at the [Brisbane Functional Programming Group](http://bfpg.org).

Running the code
----------------

* Install the [elm-platform](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform)
* Run elm-reactor in this directory.
* Open up [http://localhost:8000/gorillas.elm](http://localhost:8000/gorillas.elm)
